It is the most numerous of the Spheniscus penguins. Its nearest relatives are the African, the Humboldt penguin and the Gal\u00e1pagos penguins. The Magellanic penguin was named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who spotted the birds in 1520.\n\nAdults have black backs and white abdomens. There are two black bands between the head and the breast, with the lower band shaped in an inverted horseshoe. The head is black with a broad white border that runs from behind the eye, around the black ear-coverts and chin, and joins at the throat. Chicks and younger penguins have grey-blue backs, with a more faded grey-blue color on their chest. Magellanic penguins can live up to 25 years in the wild, but as much as 30 years in captivity.\n\nYoung birds usually have a blotched pattern on their feet, which fades as they grow up into adulthood. By the time these birds reach about ten years of age, their feet usually become all black.\n\nLike other species of penguins, the Magellanic penguin has very rigid wings used to swim under water.", "Galapagos penguin", "emperor penguin", "African penguin..... :-)", "A Humboldt Penguin.", "magellanic penguin?", "Wildlife Reserves Singapo. , Are your IQ higher than Einstein? try now...\r\n\ud83d\udc96 -- http://goo.gl/J0Uw5m Angela lee Tks for: Can you name the penguin species that's different from the rest?  <3 JurongBirdPark\nPhoto by @kulkarni.WRS is the owner/operator of Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, River Safari and Singapore Zoo.
